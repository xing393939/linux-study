1. Process management. Can a program create an instance of another program? Wait

2. Input/output. How do processes communicate with devices attached to the computer
and through them to the physical world? Can processes communicate with each
other?
3. Thread management. Can we create multiple activities or threads that share memory
or other resources within a process? Can we stop and start threads? How do we
synchronize their use of shared data structures?
4. Memory management. Can a process ask for more (or less) memory space? Can it
share the same physical memory region with other processes?
5. File systems and storage. How does a process store the user&#x2019;s data persistently so
that it can survive machine crashes and disk failures? How does the user name and
organize their data?
6. Networking and distributed systems. How do processes communicate with
processes on other computers? How do processes on different computers coordinate
their actions despite machine crashes and network problems?
7. Graphics and window management. How does a process control pixels on its
portion of the screen? How does a process make use of graphics accelerators?
8. Authentication and security. What permissions does a user or a program have, and
how are these permissions kept up to date? On what basis do we know the user (or
program) is who they say they are?

Further, in both Windows and UNIX, handles are reference counted. Whenever the kernel returns a handle, it bumps a reference counter, and whenever the process releases a handle (or exits), the reference counter is decremented. UNIX fork sets the process ID reference count to two, one for the parent and one for the child. The underlying data structure, the PCB, is reclaimed only when the reference count goes to zero, that is, when both the parent and child terminate.

use a pipe to connect two programs together, so that the output of one is the input of
another. This is called a producer-consumer relationship. For example, in the C-compiler, 
the output of the preprocessor is sent to the parser, and the output of the
parser is sent to the code-generator and then to the assembler. In the standard UNIX
shell, a pipe connecting two programs is signified by a &#x201C;|&#x201D; symbol, as in: &#x201C;cpp file.c |
cparse | cgen | as &gt; file.o&#x201D;. In this case the shell creates four separate child processes,
each connected by pipes to its predecessor and successor. Each of the phases can
run in parallel, with the parent waiting for all of them to finish.

In UNIX, when the producer finishes, it closes its side of the pipe, but there may still be

there is no difference between reading from a pipe and reading from a file.

We can take this streamlining even further. On a multicore system, it is possible or even likely that both the client and server each have their own processor. If the kernel sets up a shared memory region accessible to both the client and the server and no other processes, then the client and server can (safely) pass requests and replies back and forth, as fast as the memory system will allow, without ever traversing into the kernel or relinquishing their processors.

translation, support that is specific to a particular processor architecture.
3. Both the file system and the virtual memory system share a common pool of blocks of
physical memory. They also both depend on the disk device driver.
4. The file system can depend on the network protocol stack if the disk is physically

benefit to end users and can slow down overall performance by inserting extra steps
between the application and the services it needs. Thus, in practice, most systems adopt a
hybrid model where some operating system services are run at user-level and some are in
the kernel, depending on the specific tradeoff between code complexity and performance.

Of course, the reality is often quite different. An alternate model is for operating systems to
divide resources among applications and then allow each application to decide for itself
how best to use those resources. One can think of this as a type of federalism. If both the
operating system and applications are governments doing their own resource allocation,
they are likely to get in each other&#x2019;s way if they are not careful. As a simple example,
consider how a garbage collector works; it assumes it has a fixed amount of memory to
manage. However, as other applications start or stop, it can gain or lose memory, and if the
operating system does this reallocation transparently, the garbage collector has no hope of
adapting. We will see examples of this same design pattern in many different areas of
operating system design.

1. Address Translation Concept. We start by providing a conceptual framework for
understanding both hardware and software address translation. (Section 8.1)
2. Flexible Address Translation. We focus first on hardware address translation; we
ask how can we design the hardware to provide maximum flexibility to the operating
system kernel? (Section 8.2)
3. Efficient Address Translation. The solutions we present will seem flexible but terribly
slow. We next discuss mechanisms that make address translation much more efficient,
without sacrificing flexibility. (Section 8.3)
4. Software Protection. Increasingly, software compilers and runtime interpreters are
using address translation techniques to implement operating system functionality. 
What changes when the translation is in software rather than in hardware?

Today, we still have something similar. Complex programs often have multiple files, each of which can be compiled independently and then linked together to form the executable image. When the compiler generates the machine instructions for a single file, it cannot know where in the executable this particular file will go. Instead, the compiler generates a symbol table at the beginning of each compiled file, indicating which values will need to be modified when the individual files are assembled together.

Base and bounds translation is both simple and fast, but it lacks many of the features
needed to support modern programs. Base and bounds translation supports only coarse-grained 
protection at the level of the entire process; it is not possible to prevent a program
from overwriting its own code, for example. It is also difficult to share regions of memory
between two processes. Since the memory for a process needs to be contiguous,
supporting dynamic memory regions, such as for heaps, thread stacks, or memory mapped
files, becomes difficult to impossible.

However we choose to place new segments, as more memory becomes allocated, the
operating system may reach a point where there is enough free space for a new segment,
but the free space is not contiguous. This is called external fragmentation. The operating
system is free to compact memory to make room without affecting applications, because
virtual addresses are unchanged when we relocate a segment in physical memory. Even
so, compaction can be costly in terms of processor overhead: a typical server configuration
would take roughly a second to compact its memory.

A downside of paging is that while the management of physical memory becomes simpler,
the management of the virtual address space becomes more challenging. Compilers
typically expect the execution stack to be contiguous (in virtual addresses) and of arbitrary
size; each new procedure call assumes the memory for the stack is available. Likewise, the
runtime library for dynamic memory allocation typically expects a contiguous heap. In a
single-threaded process, we can place the stack and heap at opposite ends of the virtual
address space, and have them grow towards each other, as shown in Figure 8.5. However,
with multiple threads per process, we need multiple thread stacks, each with room to grow.

For encoding efficiency, the segment register is often implicit as part of the instruction. For
example, the x86 stack instructions such as push and pop assume the stack segment (the
index stored in the stack segment register), branch instructions assume the code segment
(the index stored in the code segment register), and so forth. As an optimization, whenever
the x86 initializes a code, stack, or data segment register it also reads the GDT entry (that
is, the top-level page table pointer and access permissions) into the processor, so the
processor can go directly to the page table on each reference.

For this, we will use a cache, a copy of some data that can be accessed more quickly than
the original. This section concerns how we might use caches to improve translation
performance. Caches are widely used in computer architecture, operating systems,
distributed systems, and many other systems; in the next chapter, we discuss more
generally when caches work and when they do not. For now, however, our focus is just on
the use of caches for reducing the overhead of address translation. There is a reason for
this: the very first hardware caches were used to improve translation performance.

Software-loaded TLB. If the TLB is effective at amortizing the cost of doing a full address translation across many memory references, we can ask a radical question: do we need hardware multi-level page table lookup on a TLB miss? This is the concept behind a software-loaded TLB. A TLB hit works as before, as a fast path. On a TLB miss, instead of doing hardware address translation, the processor traps to the operating system kernel. In the trap handler, the kernel is responsible for doing the address lookup, loading the TLB with the new translation, and restarting the application.

A common use of superpages is to map the frame buffer for the computer display. When
redrawing the screen, the processor may touch every pixel; with a high-resolution display,
this can involve stepping through many megabytes of memory. If each TLB entry maps a 4
KB page, even a large on-chip TLB with 256 entries would only be able to contain
mappings for 1 MB of the frame buffer at the same time. Thus, the TLB would need to
repeatedly do page table lookups to pull in new TLB entries as it steps through memory. An
even worse case occurs when drawing a vertical line. The frame buffer is a two-dimensional 
array in row-major order, so that each horizontal line of pixels is on a separate
page. Thus, modifying each separate pixel in a vertical line would require loading a
separate TLB entry! With superpages, the entire frame buffer can be mapped with a single
TLB entry, leaving more room for the other pages needed by the application.

TLB shootdown. On a multiprocessor, there is a further complication. Any processor
in the system may have a cached copy of a translation in its TLB. Thus, to be safe and
correct, whenever a page table entry is modified, the corresponding entry in every
processor&#x2019;s TLB has to be discarded before the change will take effect. Typically, only
the current processor can invalidate its own TLB, so removing the entry from all
processors on the system requires that the operating system interrupt each processor
and request that it remove the entry from its TLB.
This heavyweight operation has its own name: it is a TLB shootdown, illustrated in
Figure 8.15. The operating system first modifies the page table, then sends a TLB
shootdown request to all of the other processors. Once another processor has
ensured that its TLB has been cleaned of any old entries, that processor can resume.
The original processor can continue only when all of the processors have
acknowledged removing the old entry from their TLB. Since the overhead of a TLB
shootdown increases linearly with the number of processors on the system, many
operating systems batch TLB shootdown requests, to reduce the frequency of
interprocess interrupts at some increased cost in latency to complete the shootdown.

</code></pre><pre><code>8.3.4 Virtually Addressed Caches

A further issue is aliasing. Many operating systems allow processes sharing memory to
use different virtual addresses to refer to the same memory location. This is called a
memory address alias. Each process will have its own TLB entry for that memory, and the
virtual cache may store a copy of the memory for each process. The problem occurs when
one process modifies its copy; how does the system know to update the other copy?
The most common solution to this issue is to store the physical address along with the
virtual address in the virtual cache. In parallel with the virtual cache lookup, the TLB is
consulted to generate the physical address and page permissions. On a store instruction
modifying data in the virtual cache, the system can do a reverse lookup to find all the
entries that match the same physical address, to allow it to update those entries.

Together, these physically addressed caches serve a dual purpose:

memory.
2. Faster TLB misses. In the event of a TLB miss, the hardware will generate a
sequence of lookups through its multiple levels of page tables. Because the page
tables are stored in physical memory, they can be cached. Thus, even a TLB miss and
page table lookup may be handled entirely on chip.

machine inside the browser. As a result, the browser execution environment for JavaScript
must prevent malicious JavaScript programs from taking control over the browser and
possibly the rest of the client machine. Since JavaScript programs tend to be relatively
short, they are often interpreted; JavaScript can also call into a predefined set of library
routines. If a JavaScript program attempts to call a procedure that does not exist or
reference arbitrary memory locations, the interpreter will cause a runtime exception and
stop the program before any harm can be done.

What happens if we are running on top of an operating system that does not support a virtual machine? We can still emulate a virtual machine by modifying the machine code of the guest operating system kernel. For example, we can convert instructions to enable and disable interrupts to a no op. We can convert an instruction to start executing a user program to take the contents of the application memory, re-write those contents into a user-level sandbox, and start it executing. From the perspective of the guest kernel, the application program execution looks normal; it is the sandbox that keeps the application program from corrupting kernel&#x2019;s data structures and passes control to the guest kernel when the application makes a system call. 
Because of the widespread use of virtual machines, some hardware architectures have begun to add support for directly executing guest operating systems in user-mode without kernel support. We will return to this issue in a later chapter, as it is closely related to the topic of stackable virtual machines: how do we manipulate page tables to handle the case where the guest operating system is itself a virtual machine monitor running a virtual machine.

Regardless of the context, all caches face three design challenges:
1. Locating the cached copy. Because caches are designed to improve performance, a
key question is often how to quickly determine whether the cache contains the needed
data or not. Because the processor consults at least one hardware cache on every
instruction, hardware caches in particular are organized for efficient lookup.
2. Replacement policy. Most caches have physical limits on how many items they can
store; when new data arrives in the cache, the system must decide which data is most
valuable to keep in the cache and which can be replaced. Because of the high relative
latency of fetching data from disk, operating systems and applications have focused
more attention on the choice of replacement policy.
3. Coherence. How do we detect, and repair, when a cached copy becomes out of date?
This question, cache coherence, is central to the design of multiprocessor and
distributed systems. Despite being very important, cache coherence beyond the scope
of this version of the textbook. Instead, we focus on the first two of these issues.

</code></pre><pre><code>9.1 Cache Concept

The behavior of a cache on a write operation is shown in Figure 9.2. The operation is a bit
more complex, but the latency of a write operation is easier to understand. Most systems
buffer writes. As long as there is room in the buffer, the computation can continue
immediately while the data is transferred into the cache and to memory in the background.
(There are certain restrictions on the use of write buffers in a multiprocessor system, so for
this chapter, we are simplifying matters to some degree.) Subsequent read requests must
check both the write buffer and the cache &#x2014; returning data from the write buffer if it is the
latest copy.

We first discuss the part of the equation that deals with the latency of a cache hit and a
cache miss: how long does it take to access different types of memory? We caution,
however, that the issues that affect the likelihood of a cache hit or miss are just as
important to the overall memory latency. In particular, we will show that application
characteristics are often the limiting factor to good cache performance.

However, there are reasons to be skeptical. Even with temporal and spatial locality, there
are thirteen orders of magnitude difference in storage capacity from the first level cache to
the stored data of a typical data center; this is the equivalent of the smallest visible dot on
this page versus those dots scattered across the pages of a million textbooks just like this
one. How can a cache be effective if it can store only a tiny amount of the data that could
be stored?

The cost of a cache miss can also be high. There are eight orders of magnitude difference
between the latency of the first-level cache and a remote data center disk; that is
equivalent to the difference between the shortest latency a human can perceive &#x2014; roughly
