#### 3. The Programming Interface
```
What functions do we need an operating system to provide applications?
1. Process management. Can a program create an instance of another program? Wait
for it to complete? Stop or resume another running program? Send it an asynchronous
event?
2. Input/output. How do processes communicate with devices attached to the computer
and through them to the physical world? Can processes communicate with each
other?
3. Thread management. Can we create multiple activities or threads that share memory
or other resources within a process? Can we stop and start threads? How do we
synchronize their use of shared data structures?
4. Memory management. Can a process ask for more (or less) memory space? Can it
share the same physical memory region with other processes?
5. File systems and storage. How does a process store the user’s data persistently so
that it can survive machine crashes and disk failures? How does the user name and
organize their data?
6. Networking and distributed systems. How do processes communicate with
processes on other computers? How do processes on different computers coordinate
their actions despite machine crashes and network problems?
7. Graphics and window management. How does a process control pixels on its
portion of the screen? How does a process make use of graphics accelerators?
8. Authentication and security. What permissions does a user or a program have, and
how are these permissions kept up to date? On what basis do we know the user (or
program) is who they say they are?

3.1 Process Management

A different approach is to allow user programs to create and manage their own processes.
This has fostered a blizzard of innovation. Today, programs that create and manage
processes include window managers, web servers, web browsers, shell command line
interpreters, source code control systems, databases, compilers, and document
preparation systems. We could go on, but you get the idea. If creating a process is
something a process can do, then anyone can build a new version of any of these
applications, without recompiling the kernel or forcing anyone else to use it.

3.1.1 Windows Process Management

Unfortunately, there are quite a few aspects of the process that the parent might like to
control, such as: its privileges, where it sends its input and output, what it should store its
files, what to use as a scheduling priority, and so forth. We cannot trust the child process
itself to set its own privileges and priority, and it would be inconvenient to expect every
application to include code for figuring out its context. So the real interface to
CreateProcess is quite a bit more complicated in practice.

privilege
美[ˈprɪvəlɪdʒ]
n. 特权

inconvenient
美[ˌɪnkənˈvinjənt]
adj. 不方便的；打扰人的

complicated
美[ˈkɑːmplɪkeɪtɪd]
adj. 复杂的
```

```
3.1.2 UNIX Process Management

Further, in both Windows and UNIX, handles are reference counted. Whenever the kernel returns a handle, it bumps a reference counter, and whenever the process releases a handle (or exits), the reference counter is decremented. UNIX fork sets the process ID reference count to two, one for the parent and one for the child. The underlying data structure, the PCB, is reclaimed only when the reference count goes to zero, that is, when both the parent and child terminate.

bump

v. 碰撞；引起

reclaim
美[rɪˈkleɪm]

```

```
3.2 Input/Output

The Internet has a similar facility to UNIX pipes called TCP (Transmission Control
Protocol). Where UNIX pipes connect processes on the same machine, TCP provides
a bi-directional pipe between two processes running on different machines. In TCP,
data is written as a sequence of bytes on one machine and read out as the same
sequence on the other machine.

facility

n. 设施

bi-directional

adj. 双流向的

sequence
美[ˈsiːkwəns]
n. [数]数列，序列

```
3.3 Case Study: Implementing a Shell

use a pipe to connect two programs together, so that the output of one is the input of
another. This is called a producer-consumer relationship. For example, in the C-compiler, 
the output of the preprocessor is sent to the parser, and the output of the
parser is sent to the code-generator and then to the assembler. In the standard UNIX
shell, a pipe connecting two programs is signified by a “|” symbol, as in: “cpp file.c |
cparse | cgen | as > file.o”. In this case the shell creates four separate child processes,
each connected by pipes to its predecessor and successor. Each of the phases can
run in parallel, with the parent waiting for all of them to finish.

3.4 Case Study: Interprocess Communication

Three widely used forms of interprocess communication are:
1. Producer-consumer.
2. Client-server.
3. File system.
```

```
3.4.1 Producer-Consumer Communication

In UNIX, when the producer finishes, it closes its side of the pipe, but there may still be
data queued in the kernel for the consumer. Eventually, the consumer reads the last of the
data, and the read system call will return an “end of file” marker. Thus, to the consumer,
there is no difference between reading from a pipe and reading from a file.

eventually
美[ɪˈventʃuəli]
adv. 最后
```

```
3.4.2 Client-Server Communication

We can take this streamlining even further. On a multicore system, it is possible or even likely that both the client and server each have their own processor. If the kernel sets up a shared memory region accessible to both the client and the server and no other processes, then the client and server can (safely) pass requests and replies back and forth, as fast as the memory system will allow, without ever traversing into the kernel or relinquishing their processors.

streamlining

n. 流程

traverse
美[ˈtrævɜːrs]
n. 穿越

relinquish
美[rɪˈlɪŋkwɪʃ]
vt. 放弃；让出

```
3.5 Operating System Structure

Inside the operating system, there is often quite frequent interaction between these modules:
1. Many parts of the operating system depend on synchronization primitives for
coordinating access to shared data structures with the kernel.
2. The virtual memory system depends on low-level hardware support for address
translation, support that is specific to a particular processor architecture.
3. Both the file system and the virtual memory system share a common pool of blocks of
physical memory. They also both depend on the disk device driver.
4. The file system can depend on the network protocol stack if the disk is physically
located on a different machine.

```
3.5.1 Monolithic Kernels

Internal to a monolithic kernel, the operating system designer is free to develop whatever
interfaces between modules that make sense, and so there is quite a bit of variation from
operating system to operating system in those internal structures. However, two common
themes emerge across systems: to improve portability, almost all modern operating
systems have both a hardware abstraction layer and dynamically loaded device drivers.

adj. 整体的；庞大的

variation

n. 变化

emerge
美[iˈmɜːrdʒ]
v. 出现，兴起

```
3.5.2 Microkernel

A microkernel design offers considerable benefit to the operating system developer, as it
easier to modularize and debug user-level services than kernel code. Aside from a
potential reliability improvement, however, microkernels offer little in the way of visible
benefit to end users and can slow down overall performance by inserting extra steps
between the application and the services it needs. Thus, in practice, most systems adopt a
hybrid model where some operating system services are run at user-level and some are in
the kernel, depending on the specific tradeoff between code complexity and performance.

3.6 Summary and Future Directions

Of course, the reality is often quite different. An alternate model is for operating systems to
divide resources among applications and then allow each application to decide for itself
how best to use those resources. One can think of this as a type of federalism. If both the
operating system and applications are governments doing their own resource allocation,
they are likely to get in each other’s way if they are not careful. As a simple example,
consider how a garbage collector works; it assumes it has a fixed amount of memory to
manage. However, as other applications start or stop, it can gain or lose memory, and if the
operating system does this reallocation transparently, the garbage collector has no hope of
adapting. We will see examples of this same design pattern in many different areas of
operating system design.
